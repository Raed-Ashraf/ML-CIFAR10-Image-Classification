## About Data
Here I am using CIFAR10 dataset, and I got it from that link >> [LINK](https://www.binarystudy.com/2021/09/how-to-load-preprocess-visualize-CIFAR-10-and-CIFAR-100.html)

## Project Steps
1- First you need to download dataset from the link above.
2- Then you need to run the model python file to train the model.
3- Then pick up some images from the internet and put them in the same directory of the project source code (4 images or you have to edit the for loop in the main code). 
4- Finally run the main python file to use the model to predict the downloaded images.
